 "What was the fewest number of popular votes you could get and still be elected President?" <br /> 
To address this problem, we implemented several functions that are responsible for:<br />

Setting Parameters: Initialize and configure parameters for the project.<br />
File Validation: Ensure input files are valid and correctly formatted. <br />
File Reading: Efficiently read and process data from input files. <br />
Brute-Force Recursion: Implement a recursive method to explore all possible outcomes. <br />
Memoization: Optimize the recursive process by storing previous results to reduce redundancy. <br />
Data Clearing: Clean up and reset data between iterations. <br />
Results Output: Display and store the results of the analysis. <br />
